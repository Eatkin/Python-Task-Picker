# Python-Task-Picker
A command line based program to keep track of tasks

What?
It's a program that lets you maintain a list of tasks. When you sit down and think "Hmmm what should I do now?" you can ask task picker for something to do.

Why?
I often find myself forgetting things I need to or want to do. Such as I want to learn to write some music, and learn a language. But I have a lot of things like that swimming around in my head. When I sit down with some free time, I often end up doing nothing because I can't think of any one thing to do.

I made task picker so I can put the thing I want to do in the program, then when I have some time, it'll decide what to do for me.
